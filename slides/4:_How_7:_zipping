Name: How do we build an EPUB?
Subhead: Zipping it up
Notes: zip flags are as follows: # is level of compression; X is no extra file attributes (the extras throw off the file name lengths); r is recursive; D is no directory entries (no reason other than to minimize the archive)

* mimetype needs to be first and uncompressed
* add the rest

<pre><code>~/epubfiles$ zip -0X hw.epub mimetype
  adding: mimetype (stored 0%)
~/epubfiles$ zip -Xr9D hw.epub META-INF OEBPS
  adding: META-INF/container.xml (deflated 33%)
  adding: OEBPS/sample.html (deflated 32%)
  adding: OEBPS/toc.ncx (deflated 43%)
  adding: OEBPS/content.opf (deflated 48%)
</code></pre>

You can also get away with one statement due to the fact that zip won't naturally compress a file like mimetype anyway. Just make sure to list the mimetype file first.

<pre><code>~/epubfiles$ zip -XrD hw2.epub mimetype META-INF OEBPS
  adding: mimetype (stored 0%)
  adding: META-INF/container.xml (deflated 33%)
  adding: OEBPS/sample.html (deflated 28%)
  adding: OEBPS/toc.ncx (deflated 43%)
  adding: OEBPS/content.opf (deflated 48%)
</code></pre>
