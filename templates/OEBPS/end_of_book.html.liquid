        <strong>This e-book is DRM free.</strong> DRM stands for <em>Digital Rights Management</em>.
        Basically, it's the stuff that some companies use to protect digital media (such as e-books, 
        music/audio files, DVD, and so on) from being copied and redistributed. 
        It's technology that replaces trust. What was so bad about trust that it needed a replacement?
